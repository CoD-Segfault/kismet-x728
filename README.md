# kismet-x728
Scripts to configure a Raspberry Pi with a X728 UPS to use Kismet for wardriving.

Clone into /opt and run install.sh

Kismet data sources need to be added manually, at least until I have time to build some configuration scripts.  
Make sure to add your Wigle API credentials to x728.py for those sweet, sweet, fake internet points.

TODO:
Monitor battery level from UPS and act accordingly
Kismet source configuration
Prompt for Wigle API info
